1.What is the Collection framework in Java?

ans. Collection Framework is a combination of classes and interface, which is used to store and manipulate
the data in the form of objects. It provides various classes such as ArrayList, Vector, Stack, and HashSet, etc.
and interfaces such as List, Queue, Set, etc. for this purpose.

2. what is difference between  ArrayList and LinkedList?

ans. 
ArrayList  = 
-> it uses a dynamic array.
-> it is not efficient for manipulation because too much is required.
-> it is better to store and fetch data.
-> ArrayList provides random access.
-> ArrayList takes less memory overhead as it stores only object.

LinkedList
-> LinkedList uses a doubly linked list.
-> it is efficient for manipulation.
-> it does not provide random access.
-> it takes more memory overhead,as it stores the object as well as the address of that object.

3.what is the difference between iterator and listiterator?

ans. 
iterator
-> The iterator traverses the elements in the forward direction only.
-> The iterator can be used in the list,set, and queue.
-> The iterator can only perform a remove operation while traversing the collection.

listiterator 
-> Listiterator traverses the elements in the backward and forward directions both.
-> Listiterator can be used in list only.
-> Listiterator can perform ?add,? ?remove,? and?set? operation while traversing the collection.


4.What is the difference between iterator and Enumeration?

ans.

iterator

-> The iterator can traverse legacy and non-legacy elements.
-> The iterator is fail-fast.
-> The iterator is slower than Enumeration.
-> The iterator can perform a remove operation while traversing the collection.

Enumeration

-> Enumeration can traverse only legacy elements.
-> Enumeration is not fail-fast.
-> Enumeration is faster than iterator.
-> Enumeration can perform only traverse operation on the collection.

5. What is the difference between List and Set?

ans.The List and Set both extend the collection interface. However, there are some differences between the
two which are listed below`
-> The List can contain duplicate elements whereas Set includes unique items`
-> The List is an ordered collection which maintains the insertion order whereas Set is an unordered
collection which does not preserve the insertion order`
-> The List interface contains a single legacy class which is Vector class whereas the Set interface does not
have any legacy class`
-> The List interface can allow a number of null values whereas Set interface only allows a single null value.


6. What is the difference between HashSet and TreeSet?

ans. Both HashSet and TreeSet are implementations of the Set interface in Java, but they have some
differences in terms of their properties and usage{
-> Ordering: HashSet is an unordered collection of elements, while TreeSet is a sorted set of elements based
on their natural order or a custom comparatorU
 Duplication: HashSet does not allow duplicate elements, while TreeSet does not allow duplicates as wellU

-> Implementation: HashSet is implemented using a hash table, while TreeSet is implemented using a self-
balancing binary search tree (Red-Black tree)U

-> Performance: HashSet has constant-time complexity O(1) for adding, removing, and testing the existence
of an element, while TreeSet has a logarithmic-time complexity O(log n) for these operations due to the
self-balancing propertyU
-> Memory usage: HashSet uses less memory than TreeSet because it only stores the elements, while
TreeSet stores additional information for maintaining the orderU
-> Iteration: HashSet provides no guarantees regarding the order of iteration, while TreeSet guarantees the
elements are iterated in sorted orderU
-> Usage: HashSet is suitable when ordering is not important, and fast access and membership tests are
needed. TreeSet is suitable when elements need to be sorted or accessed in a specific order.


7. What is the difference between Array and ArrayList?

ans.Both arrays and ArrayLists are used to store collections of elements in Java, but they have some
differences in terms of their properties and usage{
-> Type: Arrays can store elements of primitive data types as well as objects, while ArrayList can only store
objectsU
-> Size: The size of an array is fixed once it is created, while the size of an ArrayList can be dynamically
increased or decreased by adding or removing elementsU
-> Mutability: Arrays are mutable, meaning that you can modify the elements in an array after it has been
created. ArrayList is also mutable, but the only way to modify it is by adding, removing or modifying
elementsU
-> Performance: Arrays have better performance than ArrayLists for certain operations, such as accessing
elements by index, because they are implemented as a continuous block of memory. ArrayLists, on the
other hand, use dynamic memory allocation and are implemented as a dynamic array, which may result
in more memory overhead and slower performance for certain operationsU
-> Methods: Arrays have a limited set of methods compared to ArrayLists, which provides more methods for
manipulating the collection, such as adding, removing, and sorting elementsU
-> Initialization: Arrays can be initialized with values at the time of creation, while ArrayList requires the use of
methods to add elements to the collectionU
-> Compatibility: Arrays are compatible with traditional for-loops and can be easily passed to other
methods, while ArrayList requires the use of a special for-each loop and may require more code to be
passed to other methods.

8. What is JDBC in Java?

ans.JDBC(Java Database Connectivity) is a Java API, which is helpful in interaction with the database to
retrieve, manipulate and process the data using SQL. It will make use of JDBC drivers for connecting with the
database. By using JDBC, we can access tabular data stored in various types of relational databases such as
Oracle, MySQL, MS Access, etc.

9. What is DriverManager in JDBC?

-> JDBC DriverManager is a static class in Java, through which we manage the set of JDBC drivers that are
available for an application to use.
->Multiple JDBC drivers can be used concurrently by an application, if necessary. By using a Uniform
Resource Locator(URL), each application specifies a JDBC driverG
->When we load the JDBC Driver class into an application, it registers itself to the DriverManager by using
Class.forName() or DriverManager.registerDriver(). To check this, you can have a look into the source code
of JDBC Driver classes. After this, when we call DriverManager.getConnection() method by passing the
details regarding database configuration, DriverManager will make use of registered drivers to obtain the
connection and return it to the caller program.


10. Which data types are used for storing the image and file in the database table?

-> BLOB data type is used to store the image in the database. We can also store videos and audio by using
the BLOB data type. It stores the binary type of dataG
-> CLOB data type is used to store the file in the database. It stores the character type of data.
